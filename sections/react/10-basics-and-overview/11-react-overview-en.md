# React overview

## React

React is a JavaScript library for creating interacive user interfaces in the browser

alternatives: Angular, Vue.js

## Basics of modern JavaScript UI libraries

- state-based / declarative
- component-based

## State-based / declarative

- data model which describes the entire application state
- user interactions change the data model, causing the view to update automatically

## Component-based

- "custom" HTML-Tags
- data flow via props and events
- usually unidirectional dataflow (from parent to child)

## Example: components and state in a todo app

<img src="assets/todo-components-state.svg" />

## Example: props and events in a todo app

<img src="assets/todo-components-state-props-events.svg" />

## What makes React special?

- JavaScript-based template syntax: JSX
- explicit state changes via setters
- immutable (unchangeable) state objects
