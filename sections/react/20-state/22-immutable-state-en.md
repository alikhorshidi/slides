# Immutable state

## Immutable state

**Immutability**: important concept in functional programing and with React / Redux

Data is not modified directly - instead, new data is derived from existing data (and may replace the existing data)

## Immutable state

if there are arrays or objects in the state we _could_ try and mutate them directly

don't do this - React will usually not notice the changes and may not rerender the view

state should be considered as _immutabe_ (unchangeable)

## Immutable state

When a state setter is called, React will compare:

- the object the old state points to
- the object the new state points to

If the old state and the new state reference the same object (even if it has changed), the component will not be rerendered.
