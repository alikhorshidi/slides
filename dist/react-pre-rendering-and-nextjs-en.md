# Pre-rendering and next.js

## Pre-rendering

**pre-rendering**: on first page load the browser receives pre-rendered HTML to speed up loading / displaying

advantages:

- faster initial rendering
- reduces additional API calls on the client
- easier indexing by search engines

## Pre-rendering

example:

Disable JavaScript in your browser's developer tools settings and visit [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org) - you will still see content, though some interactivity will not work (e.g. dropdowns)

## Approaches

- static site generation (pre-rendering static content)
- server-side rendering (pre-rendering dynamic content)

## Static site generation

- makes sense for data that changes infrequently (e.g. blog posts)
- when data changes the site has to be regenerated statically
- data that changes frequently (e.g. comments on a blog post) would not be part of the pre-rendering

## Server-side rendering

- when a React page is opened a prerendered version of it is created on the server and sent to the client
- requires JavaScript on the server (_node.js_)

## Server-side rendering and data fetching

usual process for fetching data in a React app:

- React app is sent to the client
- app renders initially with no data
- client requests additional data
- data is sent to the client
- app re-rendes

process with server-side rendering:

- data is fetched on the server
- app is rendered on the server
- pre-rendered app and the corresponding data for making it dynamic are sent to the client

## Tools

- _gatsby.js_: static site generation
- _next.js_: static site generation, server-side rendering

# Next.js

## Next.js

React framework that supports:

- static site generation
- server-side rendering
- simple file-based routing
- backend / API development in the same project (for simple projects)

## Resources

The next.js website has great materials: <https://nextjs.org>

# Create-next-app

## Create-next-app

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app --example typescript
```

## Project structure

possible project structure:

- _pages_
- _public_: static assets
- _styles_
- _components_

## Development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment with node.js

to build a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

to run it (on the server):

```bash
npm run start
```

## Deployment to a static server

possible only if no server-side rendering is needed (i.e. no `getServerSideProps`)

change the _build_ script in _package.json_ to: `next build && next export`

then build the static version (to the _out_ folder) via:

```bash
npm run build
```

(see <https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/static-html-export>)

# Pages and navigation

## Pages and navigation

Example page definition:

```js
// pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link';
import Head from 'next/head';

const Index = () => (
  <div>
    <Head>
      <title>Home</title>
    </Head>
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>About Page</a>
    </Link>
    <p>Hello Next.js</p>
  </div>
);

export default Index;
```

## Pages and navigation

special components provided by _next_:

- `Link`: link inside a single-page application
- `Head`: enables easily setting content of the page's `<head>` element

## Pages and navigation

Task: create further pages

# Pre-rendering and data fetching

## Pre-rendering and data fetching

in next.js we can define code that is executed at several different points:

- code that runs when building
- code that runs on the server
- code that runs in the browser

## Pre-rendering and data fetching

when building, next.js will pre-render all entries in the `pages` directory

some pages are pre-rendered without any additional input, others might be connected to data sources

## Pre-rendering and data fetching

special (asynchronous) functions that we can export from a page definition file:

- `getStaticProps` (runs during build)
- `getServerSideProps` (runs on user request)

can load data and pass them into the page components as props

are only executed on the build machine or server respectively â†’ may read files or make direct database queries

The functionality of _fetch_ will be polyfilled automatically

## Pre-rendering

example: a page that contains a new Joke every time it is rebuilt

```tsx
const ChuckNorrisJoke = (props: Props) => (
  <article>{props.joke}</article>
);

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch(
    'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random'
  );
  const text = (await res.json()).value;
  return { props: { joke: text } };
};

export default ChuckNorrisJoke;
```

## Pre-rendering

example: a page that contains a new Joke every time it is accessed

```tsx
const ChuckNorrisJoke = (props: Props) => (
  <article>{props.joke}</article>
);

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch(
    'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random'
  );
  const text = (await res.json()).value;
  return { props: { joke: text } };
};

export default ChuckNorrisJoke;
```

## Pre-rendering

exercises:

- pre-render a todo application with todos from <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos>
- pre-render a list of pokemon with data from <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon>

# Route parameters

## Route parameters

we can query parameters from URLs like these:

- `/posts/3`
- `/posts/?postid=3`

## Route parameters

Route parameters are enclosed in square brackets in the file name, e.g. `pages/spacex-launches/[id].js`

## Route parameters

pre-rendering pages based on a set of route parameters - via `getStaticPaths`

```tsx
export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  // get a list of paths to pre-render
  const res = await fetch(
    'https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/latest'
  );
  const latest = (await res.json()).flight_number;
  const paths = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= latest; i++) {
    paths.push({ params: { id: i.toString() } });
  }
  return { paths, fallback: false };
};
```

`getStaticPaths` returns an array describing the routes under the entry `paths` - the entries are passed to `getStaticProps`

## Route parameters

after implementing `getStaticPaths` we can pre-render pages with dynamic routes

```bash
npm run build
```

## Route parameters

Dynamically querying route parameters:

```js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>detail view for post {router.query.id}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Post;
```

# Deployment

## Deployment

_next_ is developed by _Vercel_: good integration for deployment

## Deployment on Vercel

1. Upload to GitHub or similar
2. Connect GitHub with Vercel and set up the project
