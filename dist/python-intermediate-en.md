# Data types in Python

## Basic data types

- int
- float
- bool
- NoneType
- string

## Collections

- list
- tuple
- dict

## Other data types

- decimal
- complex
- bytes, bytearray
- set, frozenset
- NamedTuple
- ...

# None

## None

`None` is a Singleton:

- there is only ever a single instance of it inside a running Python program
- multiple variables may refer to that same instance

## Comparisons via "is"

The keyword `is` checks whether two references / names refer to the same object.

```py
a = [1, 2]
b = a
x = [1, 2]

a == b # True
a is b # True
a == x # True
a is x # False
```

## None and "is"

As `None` is a singleton we can check for it via `is None`:

```py
if a is None:
    print("a is None")
```

# bool

## bool

`True` or `False`

```py
a = True
if a:
    print('hello')
```

## bool

Internally `False` behaves almost like `0` and `True` behaves almost like `1`

```py
False + True # 1
```

# Numbers

## Operations with numbers

- Integer division: `10 // 3`
- Remainder: `10 % 3`
- Power: `2 ** 3`

## Underscores in literals

to help us read long numbers:

```py
earth_circumference = 40075017
earth_circumference = 40_075_017
```

## int

integers of arbitrary size

## int

Other numeral systems:

```py
a = 42 # decimal
b = 0b101010 # binary
c = 0o52 # octal
d = 0x2a # hexadecimal
```

```py
e = int('101010', 2)
```

## float

64 bit float

```py
a = 2.3
b = .2
c = 6e23
d = float('nan')
e = float('inf')
```

## float

**rounding errors**: some numbers cannot be represented as floating point numbers, they will always be approximations

examples in the decimal system: 1/3, 1/7, Ï€

examples in the binary system (i.e. _floats_): 1/10, 1/5, 1/3, Ï€

example: Ï€ + Ï€ evaluates to `6.2` when using decimal numbers with a precision of 2 (a more exact result would be `6.3`)

example: `0.1 + 0.2` evaluates to ~ `0.30000000000000004` when using 64 bit floats

## float

```py
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
# False
```

```py
import math

math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
# True
```

## float

_IEEE 754_: standardized floating point arithmetic

Python mostly acts as defined in the standard

deviation from the standard: in some cases Python will throw exceptions where the standard produces a result - e.g. `1.0/0.0`

Special numbers in IEEE 754:

- `inf` and `-inf` (infinite values)
- `nan` (not-a-number: undefined / unknown value)

## complex

```py
a = 2 + 3j
```

## Augmented assignment

For binary operators there are so-called _augmented assignments_:

```py
a = a + 1
```

short form (augmented assignment):

```py
a += 1
```

other operations: `-=`, `*=`, ...

# Character encodings

## Unicode characters

_Unicode_: catalog of over 100,000 international characters, each with a unique identifying name and number (usually written in hexadecimal)

examples:

- _K_: U+004B (_Latin capital letter K_)
- _?_: U+003F (_Question mark_)
- _Ã¤_: U+00E4 (_Latin small letter a with a diaeresis_)
- _â‚¬_: U+20AC (_Euro sign_)
- ðŸ™‚: U+1F642 (_Slightly smiling face_)

[tables of all Unicode characters](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Unicode/Character_reference)

## Character encodings

_Character encoding_ = mapping of characters to bit sequences

- _ASCII_: encodes the first 128 Unicode characters, can represent characters like _A_, _!_, _\\$_, _space_, _line break_
- _Latin1_: encodes the first 256 Unicode characters, can represent ASCII characters and characters like _Ã¤_, _Ã¡_, _ÃŸ_, _Â§_
- _UTF-8_, _UTF-16_, _UTF-32_: encode all Unicode characters

A character encoding is necessary in order to write text to disk or transfer it over the network

## Character encodings

Examples in ASCII / Latin1 / UTF-8:

- `!` â†” `00100001`
- `A` â†” `01000001`
- `a` â†” `01100001`

Examples in Latin1:

- `Ã„` â†” `11000100`

Examples in UTF-8:

- `Ã„` â†” `11000011 10100100`
- `ðŸ™‚` â†” `11110000 10011111 10011001 10000010`

## UTF-8

In many areas (in particular on the web) _UTF-8_ has become the standard text encoding

In UTF-8 the first 128 Unicode characters can be encoded in just 8 bit

All other characters need either 16, 24 or 32 bit

## UTF-32

UTF-32 encodes the Unicode code points directly

Depending on the area of application the byte order may differ (big endian or little endian)

example:

ðŸ™‚ (U+1F642) â†” `00 01 F6 42` (big endian) or `42 F6 01 00` (little endian)

## Line breaks

Line breaks can be represented by the characters `LF` (line feed, `U+000A`) and / or `CR` (carriage return, `U+000D`)

- `LF`: Standard on Linux, MacOS
- `CRLF`: Standard on Windows, in network protocols like HTTP

In string literals `LF` is often represented by `\n` and `CR` is represented by `\r`

# Strings

## Strings

In Python 3 strings are sequences of Unicode characters

## String literals

Examples:

```py
a = "test"
b = 'test'
```

## Multi-line string literals

```py
a = """this
is a multi-line
string literal.
"""
```

## Escape sequences

Some characters may be entered via so-called _escape sequences_:

```py
a = "He said:\n\"Hi!\""
```

## Escape sequences

- `\'` â†’ `'`
- `\"` â†’ `"`
- `\\` â†’ `\`
- `\n` â†’ Line Feed (line separator on Unix)
- `\r\n` â†’ Carriage Return + Line Feed (line separator on Windows)
- `\t` â†’ Tab
- `\xHH` or `\uHHHH` or `\UHHHHHHHH` â†’ Unicode-Codepoint (hexadecimal)

## Raw Strings

If we don't need to use any escape sequences in a string:

```py
path = r"C:\documents\foo\news.txt"
```

This can be useful when writing Windows paths and regular expressions

## String methods

- `.lower()`
- `.upper()`

## String methods

- `.startswith(...)`
- `.endswith(".txt")`

## String methods

- `.center(10)`
- `.ljust(10)`
- `.rjust(10)`

## String methods

- `.strip()`
- `.split(' ')`
- `.splitlines()`
- `.join()`

## Exercise: formatting Othello

input:

```txt
  Rodorigo. Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly
That thou (Iago) who hast had my purse,
As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this
```

target:

```txt
Rodorigo. Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly           1
That thou (Iago) who hast had my purse,                    2
As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this         3
```

## Exercise: formatting Othello

tasks:

- remove leading whitespace of each line
- add a line number to the end of each line and place the line number right-aligned at character 70
- (place line numbers only in every 5th line)
- (instead of placing line numbers at character 70, use the longest line as a reference)

# String formatting

## String formatting

String formatting = placing values in strings

Methods:

```py
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

```py
greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## String formatting: methods

```py
city = 'Vienna'
temperature = 23.7

# rather obsolete
'weather in %s: %fÂ°C' % (city, temperature)

'weather in {0}: {1}Â°C'.format(city, temperature)
'weather in {}: {}Â°C'.format(city, temperature)
'weather in {c}: {t}Â°C'.format(c=city, t=temperature)

f'weather in {city}: {temperature}Â°C'
```

## Format specification

- `.4f`: four decimal places after the decimal point
- `.4g`: four decimal places

```py
print(f"Pi is {math.pi:.4f}")
# Pi is 3.1416
print(f"Pi is {math.pi:.4g}")
# Pi is 3.142
```

## Format specification

- `>8`: right-aligned (total width 8)
- `^8`: centered
- `<8`: left-aligned

```py
print(f"{first_name:>8}")
print(f"{last_name:>8}")
```

```txt
    John
     Doe
```

## Format specification

combination:

```py
print(f"{menu_item:<12} {price:>5.2}$")
```

```txt
Burger        11.90$
Salad          8.90$
Fries          3.90$
```

# Lists

## Lists

Lists are mutable sequences of objects; they are usually used to store homogenous entries of the same type and structure

```py
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
```

## Operations on lists

The following operations will also work on other _sequences_ - e.g. tuples, strings or bytes

- accessing elements (via index): `users[2]`
- accessing multiple elements (sublist): `users[2:4]`
- concatenation: `users + users`
- repetition: `3 * users`
- length: `len(users)`
- for loop: `for user in users:`
- if clause : `if 'Tim' in users:`

## Operations on lists - mutations

Lists can be mutated directly (while strings and tuples can't be):

- appending: `users.append("Dan")`
- inserting: `users.insert(2, "Max")`
- removing the last element: `users.pop()`
- removing an element by index: `users.pop(2)`

## Sorting lists

sorting by default order (alphabetically for strings)

```py
l.sort()
```

sorting by custom order:

- by string length
- by occurence of letter "a"

```py
l.sort(key=len)

def count_a(s):
    return s.count("a")
l.sort(key=count_a)
```

## Exercises

- shuffling cards
- list of prime numbers
- insertion sort

# Tuples

## Creating tuples

Entries are separated by commas, _usually_ surrounded by round brackets.

```py
empty_tuple = ()
single_value = ('Thomas', )
single_value = 'Thomas',
two_values = ('Thomas', 'Smith')
two_values = 'Thomas', 'Smith'
```

## Unpacking of tuples

```py
time = (23, 45, 0)

hour, minute, second = time
```

swapping variables:

```py
a, b = b, a
```

# Bytes

## Bytes

when reading from storage media or reading network responses we may have to deal with bytes: sequences of integers in the range of 0 to 255 (8 bits)

bytes may represent images, text, data, ...

## Hexadecimal notation

bytes are often written in hexadecimal notation instead of decimal:

- 1<sub>dec</sub> = 1<sub>hex</sub>
- 9<sub>dec</sub> = 9<sub>hex</sub>
- 10<sub>dec</sub> = a<sub>hex</sub>
- 15<sub>dec</sub> = f<sub>hex</sub>
- 16<sub>dec</sub> = 10<sub>hex</sub>
- 17<sub>dec</sub> = 11<sub>hex</sub>
- 31<sub>dec</sub> = 1f<sub>hex</sub>
- 32<sub>dec</sub> = 20<sub>hex</sub>

## Hexadecimal notation

hexadecimal literals in Python:

- 1 = `0x1`
- 9 = `0x9`
- 10 = `0xa`
- 15 = `0xf`
- 16 = `0x10`
- 17 = `0x11`
- 31 = `0x1f`
- 32 = `0x20`

## Creation

creating bytes from a list of numbers:

```py
a = bytes([0, 64, 112, 160, 255])
b = bytes([0, 0x40, 0x70, 0xa0, 0xff])
```

creating bytes from a byte string literal:

```py
c = b"\x00\x40\x70\xa0\xff"
```

ASCII values can be included directly (`\x40` = "@", `\x70` = "p"):

```py
d = b"\x00@p\xa0\xff"
```

## Bytes

Standard representation in Python:

```py
print(bytes([0x00, 0x40, 0x70, 0xa0, 0xff]))
```

```py
b'\x00@p\xa0\xff'
```

Where possible, bytes will be represented by ASCII characters; otherwise their hex code will be shown

## Bytes and Strings

Bytes will often hold encoded text

If we know the encoding we can convert between bytes and strings:

```py
'Ã¤'.encode('utf-8')
# b'\xc3\xa4'
```

```py
b'\xc3\xa4'.decode('utf-8')
# 'Ã¤'
```

# Sequences

## Sequences

Python sequences consist of other Python objects

examples:

- lists
- tuples
- strings
- bytes

## Operations on sequences

- accessing an element (via index): `s[2]`
- accessing multiple elements: `s[2:4]`
- concatenation: `s + t`
- repetition: `3 * s`
- length: `len(s)`
- for loop: `for el in s:`
- if clause : `if el in s:`

## Operations

Accessing elements

```py
users = ['mike', 'tim', 'theresa']

users[0] # 'mike'
users[-1] # 'theresa'
```

## Operations

Changing elements

(if the sequence is mutable)

```py
users = ['mike', 'tim', 'theresa']

users[0] = 'molly'
```

## Operations

Accessing multiple elements

```py
users = ['mike', 'tim', 'theresa']

users[0:2] # ['mike', 'tim']
```

## Operations

Concatenation

```py
users = ['mike', 'tim', 'theresa']

new_users = users + ['tina', 'michelle']
```

## Operations

Repetition

```py
users = ['mike', 'tim', 'theresa']

new_users = users * 3
```

## Operations

Length

```py
users = ['mike', 'tim', 'theresa']

print(len(users))
```

## Operations

for loop

```py
users = ['mike', 'tim', 'theresa']

for user in users:
    print(user.upper())
```

# Dictionaries

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are mappings of keys to values

```py
person = {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "nationality": "Canada",
    "birth_year": 1980
}
```

## Dictionaries

Accessing entries

```py
person["first_name"] # "John"
```

## Dictionaries

Iterating over dictionaries

```py
for entry in person:
    print(entry)
```

This will yield the keys: `"first_name"`, `"last_name"`, `"nationality"`, `"birth_year"`

Since Python 3.7 the keys will always remain in insertion order

## Dictionaries

Iterating over key-value-pairs:

```py
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f'{key}, {value}')
```

## Operations on dictionaries

```py
d = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two'}

d[2]
d[2] = 'TWO'
d[3] # KeyError
d.get(3) # None
d.setdefault(2, 'n')
d.setdefault(3, 'n')

d.keys()
d.items()

d1.update(d2)
```

## Valid keys

Any immutable object can act as a dictionary key. The most common types of keys are strings.

# Object-oriented programming and classes

## Object orientation in Python: "Everything is an object"

```py
a = 20

a.to_bytes(1, "big")

"hello".upper()
```

## Types and instances

```py
message = "hello"

type(message)

isinstance(message, str)
```

## Classes

Classes may represent _various_ things, e.g.:

- a Message inside an e-mail program
- a user of a website
- a car in a racing game
- a shopping basket in an online shop
- a bank account
- ...

## Classes

The definition of a class usually encompasses:

- a "data structure" (attributes)
- a "behavior" (methods)

## Classes

example: class `BankAccount`

- "data structure" (attributes)
- "behavior" (methods)

## Defining classes

```py
class MyClass():

    # the method __init__ initializes the object
    def __init__(self):
        # inside any method, self will refer
        # to the current instance of the class
        self.message = "hello"

instance = MyClass()
instance.message # "hello"
```

## Private attributes and methods

Attributes and methods that should not be used from the outside are prefixed with `_`

We're all consenting adults here: <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2003-October/025932.html>

## Example: class "Length"

```py
a = Length(2.54, "cm")
b = Length(3, "in")

a.unit
a.value
```

## Exercise: classes "TodoList" and "Todo"

```py
tdl = TodoList("groceries")

tdl.add("milk")
tdl.add("bread")

print(tdl.todos)
tdl.todos[0].toggle()

tdl.stats() # {open: 1, completed: 1}
```

# Inheritance and composition

## Inheritance and composition

often we can use some class(es) as the basis for another class

e.g.:

- `User` class as the basis of the `AdminUser` class
- `TicTacToeGame` as the basis of `TicTacToeGameGUI`

## Inheritance and composition

inheritance: an `AdminUser` _is_ a `User`

composition: `TicTacToeGameGUI` could _use_ `TicTacToeGame` in the background

common mantra: _composition over inheritance_: don't overuse inheritance

## Inheritance

inheritance:

```py
class User():
    ...

class AdminUser(User):
    ...
```

the `AdminUser` class automatically inherits all existing methods from the `User` class

## Composition

composition:

```py
class TicTacToeGame():
    ...

class TicTacToeGameGUI():
    def __init__(self):
        self.game = TicTacToeGame()
```

## Inheritance

example of inheritance - database model in Django:

```py
from django.db import models

class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
```

# Control structures

## Control structures

- `if`
- loops
  - `while`
  - `for ... in ...`
  - `for ... in range()`
- `try ... except ...`

# if

## if

From a previous example:

```py
if age_seconds < 1000000000:
    print("You are less than 1 billion seconds old")
else:
    print("You are older than 1 billion seconds")
```

## Conditions

When using conditions for `if` / `while` we usually use expressions that evaluate to boolean values.

However, we can also use other types:

```py
a = 0
if a: ...

name = input("enter your name")
if name: ...

products = []
if products: ...
```

These types are converted to boolean values before being used as criteria for the if condition.

## Conditions

Any value may be used as a condition in Python. Most values will be "truthy".

Only these values are considered "falsy" - calling `bool(...)` will return `False`:

- `False`
- `0`, `0.0`
- `None`
- empty collections / sequences (`""`, `[]`, `()`, `{}`)
- (before Python 3.5: `datetime.time(0, 0, 0)`)

## Conditions

Not "pythonic":

```py
name = input("Enter your name:")
if name != "":
    ...
```

"pythonic" version:

```py
name = input("Enter your name:")
if name:
    ...
```

## Chaining comparisons

checking if `age` lies in the range of 13-19:

```py
13 <= age and age <= 19
```

short version:

```py
13 <= age <= 19
```

checking if `a` and `b` are both `0` (short version):

```py
a == b == 0
```

## if expressions

An expression that evaluates to one of two possibilities based on a boolean criterion

```py
size = 'small' if length < 100 else 'big'
```

in other languages this could be written as:

```js
// JavaScript
size = length < 100 ? 'small' : 'big';
```

# For loops

## For loops with tuple unpacking

Recap: tuple unpacking

```py
time = (23, 45, 0)

hour, minute, second = time
```

## For loops with tuple unpacking

Enumerating list items:

```py
l = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

for i, name in enumerate(l):
    print(f'{i}: {name}')
```

Enumerate returns a data structure that behaves like this list:

```py
[(0, 'Alice'), (1, 'Bob'), (2, 'Charlie')]
```

## For loops with tuple unpacking

Listing directory contents (including subfolders) via `os.walk`:

```py
import os

for directory, dirs, files in os.walk("C:\\"):
    print(f"{directory} {files}")
```

```
C:\ []
C:\PerfLogs []
C:\Program Files []
C:\ProgramData []
...
```

# Comprehensions

## List comprehensions

_List comprehensions_ enable the creation of lists based on existing lists

In other programming languages this is often done via `map` and `filter`

## List comprehensions

_Transforming each entry_:

```py
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

uppercase_names = [name.upper() for name in names]
```

result:

```py
["ALICE", "BOB", "CHARLIE"]
```

## List comprehensions

_Filtering_:

```py
amounts = [10, -7, 8, 19, -2]

positive_amounts = [amount for amount in amounts if amount > 0]
```

result:

```py
[10, 8, 19]
```

## List comprehensions

Generic syntax:

```py
new_list = [new_entry for entry in old_list]

new_list = [new_entry for entry in old_list if condition]
```

## Dictionary comprehensions

```py
colors: {
  'red': '#ff0000',
  'blue': '#0000ff',
  'green': '#008000'
}

m_colors = { color: colors[color][1:] for color in colors}
```

## Exercises

- todo list: add functionality to remove completed entries

# Exceptions

## Types of exceptions

- AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError
- NameError
- TypeError
- ValueError
- IOError
- ZeroDivisionError
- ...

Exercise: try and trigger all of the above exceptions

## Catching exceptions

```py
age_str = input("Enter your age")
try:
    age = int(age_str)
except ValueError:
    print("Could not parse input as number")
```

## Catching exceptions

```py
age_str = input("Enter your age")
try:
    age = int(age_str)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Could not parse input as number")
    print(e)
    print(e.args)
```

## Catching exceptions

Catching multiple types of exceptions:

```py
try:
    file = open("log.txt", encoding="utf-8")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("could not find log file")
except PermissionError:
    print("reading of file is not permitted")
except Exception:
    print("error when reading file")
```

## Catching exceptions

Using `finally`:

```py
try:
    file = open("log.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8")
    file.write("abc")
    file.write("def")
except IOError:
    print("Error when writing to file")
finally:
    file.close()
```

## Catching exceptions

Using `else`:

```py
try:
    file = open("log.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8")
except IOError:
    print("could not open file")
else:
    # no errors expected here
    file.write("abc")
    file.write("def")
file.close()
```

## Python philosophy: EAFP

LBYL: _Look before you leap_

EAFP: _It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission_

(example: parsing numbers)

# Raising exceptions

## Raising exceptions

```py
raise ValueError('test')
```

## Re-raising caught exceptions

```py
try:
    ...
except ClientError as e
    if "DryRunOperation" not in str(e):
        raise
```

## Custom exceptions

We can define custom exceptions as subclasses of other exception classes:

```py
class MoneyParseException(Exception):
    pass

raise MoneyParseException()
```

# Modules and packages

## Modules and packages

- Module = collection of Python objects that can be imported
- Package = collection of modules

(packages are actually a special type of modules)

## Example imports

- `urllib` = package
- `urllib.request` = module
- `urllib.request.urlopen` = function

<!-- list separator -->

- `sys` = module
- `sys.path` = object

## Example imports

Typical imports:

```py
import module1
import module2
from package3 import module3a, module3b
from module4 import object4a, object4b
from package5.module5 import object5a, object5b
```

Specific examples:

```py
import os
import sys
from urllib import request, response
from math import sqrt, pi
from http.client import HTTPConnection, HTTPSConnection
```

## Shorter names for imports

Typically used in an interactive console to save keystrokes:

Short names:

```py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tkinter as tk
```

Importing everything from a module (usually not recommended):

```py
from math import *
```

## Automatic import of submodules

When importing _some_ packages, submodules will be imported automatically.

Examples:

```py
import os
import numpy as np

os.path.join(...)
np.random.randint(10)
```

Counterexample - this will fail:

```py
import urllib

urllib.request.urlopen(...)
```

## Conventions for imports

- all imports in a Python file _should_ be at the start of the file
- imports _should_ be split into three groups:
  - imports from the standard library
  - imports from other libraries
  - imports within the project

# Custom modules

## Custom modules

Module as a directory:

```
- foo/
  - __init__.py
```

```py
# __init__.py
a = 1
b = 2
```

## Custom modules

Module as a directory with separated defintions:

```
- foo/
  - __init__.py
  - _a_mod.py
  - _b_mod.py
```

```py
# __init__.py
from foo._a_mod import a
from foo._b_mod import b
```

## Resolving imports

To see all search paths for imports:

```py
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

## Compilation of modules

Imported modules will be saved in a compiled form, making subsequent loading of the modules faster.

Compiled versions will be saved in the folder `__pycache__`

## Module name and entrypoint

inside a an imported module, the variable `__name__` gives its name

if a Python file was run directly instead of being imported, its `__name__` will be `"__main__"`

```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("this file was run directly (and not imported)")
```

# PIP & pipenv

## PIP

_PIP_ = Package manager for Python

Simple usage:

```bash
pip install requests numpy
```

Packages and their dependencies are looked up in the Python Package Index: <https://pypi.org/>

## PIP

Installing specific Versions:

```
pip install requests==1.1
pip install numpy>=1.16
```

## PIP

dependency list in a requirements file that can be shared with others:

requirements.txt:

```
requests==1.1
numpy>=1.16
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pipenv

_Pipenv_: virtual environments that enable installation of different package versions per project

## Pipenv

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

## Pipenv

Using pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install requests
pipenv install numpy
```

This creates two files:

- _Pipfile_: general dependency information
- _Pipfile.lock_: exact version numbers

## Pipenv

Executing Python scripts in a PIP environment:

```bash
pipenv run python foo.py
```

# Functions

## Arbitrary number of Arguments (args / kwargs)

```py
def foo(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args)
    print(kwargs)

foo("one", "two", x="hello")
# args: ("one", "two")
# kwargs: {"x": "hello"}
```

`args` will be a tuple, `kwargs` will be a dictionary

## Arbitrary number of Arguments (args / kwargs)

Task: recreate `range()` by using a while loop

## Unpacking of parameter lists

```py
numbers = ["one", "two", "three"]

# equivalent:
print(numbers[0], numbers[1], numbers[2])

print(*numbers)
```

## Global and local scope

`global` / `nonlocal`

change the behavior of _assignments_

## Global and local scope

Example: rock, paper, scissors

```py
import random
wins = 0
losses = 0
def play_rock_paper_scissors():
    player = input("rock, paper or scissors?")
    opponent = random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
    if player == opponent:
        pass
    elif (
        (player == "rock" and opponent == "scissors")
        or (player == "paper" and opponent == "rock")
        or (player == "scissors" and opponent == "paper")
    ):
        global wins
        wins += 1
    else:
        global losses
        losses += 1
while input("play? (y/n)") != "n":
    play_rock_paper_scissors()
print(f"won: {wins}, lost: {losses}")
```

## Global and local scope

A better alternative to the `global` keyword is often to create a class:

```py
import random
class RockPaperScissors():
    def __init__(self):
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0
    def play(self):
        ...
    def run(self):
        while input("play? (y/n)") != "n":
            self.play()
        print(f"won: {wins}, lost: {losses}")
```

# Object references and mutations

## Object references and mutations

Recap: What does this program print?

```py
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b.append(4)
print(a)
```

## Object references and mutations

```py
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b.append(4)
print(a)
```

The Program prints `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

`a` and `b` refer to the same object.

## Object references and mutations

The statement `b = a` creates a new reference that refers to the same object.

Operations that create new references:

- assignments (`b = a`)
- function calls (`myfunc(a)` - a new internal variable will be created)
- insertions into collections (e.g. `mylist.append(a)`)
- ...

## Object references and functions

Passing an object into a function will create a new reference to that same object (_call by sharing_).

```py
def foo(a_inner):
    print(id(a_inner))

a_outer = []
foo(a_outer)
print(id(a_outer))
```

## Object references and functions

recommended principle for functions:

**Functions should not mutate parameters**

or more generally:

**Functions should only interact with the Python environment by receiving parameters and returning values** (They should not have any _side effects_)

## Object references and functions

```py
def remove_middle_element(list_in):
    list_in.pop(len(list_in) // 2)
    return list_in

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = remove_middle_element(a)
print(b)
print(a)
```

What does the above example print?

## Object references and functions

Possible implementations for `remove_middle_element`:

- as a function without side effects
- as a method of `AdvancedList`

Compare: `sorted()` and `list.sort()` in Python

## Functions without side effects

The function does not mutate the list that was passed in - instead it returns a new list.

```py
def remove_middle_element(list_in):
    list_out = list_in.copy()
    list_out.pop(len(list_out) // 2)
    return list_out

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = remove_middle_element(a)
```

## Method in a custom class

Relaxation of the principle for methods: Entries in `self` _may be mutated_.

The following method will change the object internally and return nothing.

```py
class AdvancedList(list):
    def remove_middle_element(self):
        self.pop(len(self) // 2)

a = AdvancedList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
a.remove_middle_element()
```

## Object references and functions

Common recommendations (no side effects):

- Don't modify parameters that are passed in (exception: `self`)
- Don't set global variables (Don't use the `global` statement)

Strict rules (pure functions):

- Don't read global variables
- Don't do any I/O (interactions with disk / network / ...)

Pure functions only interact with their environment by receiving parameters and returning values.

The "purer" a function is the easier it is to reuse and test.

## Mutating default arguments

Unexpected behavior in Python when default parameters are mutated:

```py
def register_file_formats(formats=["py", "pyc"]):
    for format in formats:
        formats.append(format.upper())
    # ...
    print(formats)

register_file_formats(["py"]) # ["py", "PY"]
register_file_formats()
# ["py", "pyc", "PY", "PYC"]
register_file_formats()
# ["py", "pyc", "PY", "PYC", "PY", "PYC", "PY", "PYC"]
```

(web search: _mutable default arguments_)

# Python versions

## Python versions

Python 2 vs Python 3

## Strings and Bytes

major change in Python 3:

strict separation of text (strings) and binary data (bytes)

in Python 2: data types `bytes`, `str` and `unicode`

## Print

Python 2:

```py
print "a",
```

Python 3:

```py
print("a", end="")
```

## Division

Python 2:

```py
10 / 3    # 3
```

## range

in Python 2: `range()` returns a list, `xrange()` returns an object that uses less memory

in Python 3: `range()` returns an object that uses less memory

## input

in Python 2: `input()` will evaluate / execute the input, `raw_input()` returns a string

in Python 3: `input()` returns a string

## \_\_future\_\_ imports

Getting some of the behavior of Python 3 in Python 2:

```py
from __future__ import print_function
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from __future__ import division
```

## Python-Future

Compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3

Enables supporting both Python 2 and Python 3 from the same codebase
